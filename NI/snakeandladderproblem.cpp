// Given a 5x6 snakes and ladders board, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or 
// last cell (30th cell) from the source (1st cell).
// You are given an integer N denoting the total number of snakes and ladders and an array arr[] of 2*N 
// size where 2*i and (2*i + 1)th 
// values denote the starting and ending point respectively of ith snake or ladder. 
// The board looks like the following.
// Note: Assume that you have complete control over the 6 sided dice. No ladder starts from 1st cell.
