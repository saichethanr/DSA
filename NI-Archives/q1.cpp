//  Brand, Coop and Murph are scientists and are conducting n distinct experiments of various difficulties. All three want to do the experiments in the order of the difficulty of the experiment but there’s a catch. 
//  They are currently in different time dimensions but are connected by one thing – gravity! If at least two of them end up doing the experiment in the same order then due to gravitational anomaly all the experiment will fail.
//   Now given the number n and a list of difficulties di for each experiment,
//   is there a way to order the experiments such that:      All 3 do the experiments in the order of difficulty from least difficult (denote by a lesser difficulty value) to most difficult.    
//     The order of these experiments should be unique i.e no two scientists can do the experiments in the same order.

//  Input: 1 <= n <=2000, 1 <= di <=2000 

// Output: YES or NO
