weighted graph



Complete graph
Where all the nodes in the graph are connected to all other nodes in the graph.
"where every node is connected to every other node of the graph"

Cyclic graph
"Graph containing a Cycle"

Euler
"where the degree of each node is even"

Hamiltonian Graph
"If in a graph you are able to make a round where u start from a node and you are able to reach back to the node after making a round and visiting all other nodes exactly once then such type of a graph is known as Hamiltonian graph. And Such a cycle is called as Hamiltonian cycle"
